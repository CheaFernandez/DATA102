I don't have any visible scars, or any pimple marks but my skin is a bit textured. I'm kind of in the lighter moreno side. A bit tan looking. Would appreciate if someone can recommend me one or two everyday-use products specifically for skin texture and dark under eyes. Preferably something I could buy online bec I'm a bit shy to approach physical shops. Also helpful to include the recommended shade.

t1_l5bjkh0,hyoukaaaa,"Use a good primer!! I used the Mac Primer Studio Fix and my makeup lasted the whole day. Got ready before lunch and ceremony ended right before dinner, walang hulas talaga!
Tips:
Allow some time for your skin to absorb your base products. I wait at least 10 mins each between moisturizer, spf, and primer. It will make sure the products are set (meaning you avoid moving them when you place the next layer)
For the primer, press it into your skin to make sure they prevent your natural oils from breaking down your makeup later on for longer.
Use setting spray in between layers (Urban Decay is holy grail, but I used Nyx and it worked just as well together with the other steps)
Set your final layer with powder by pressing/patting the puff/sponge into your skin
Also helps to do some trial looks before the event :) that way, you can adjust or test out different techniques/looks/products",4,1,t1_l5b3ttx,t3_1cy3t0z,2024-05-23T13:30:28.567Z

Not really a makeup user but since my husband once told me that even the slight dab of lipstick makes my features pop, I thought I'd start light with just a bit of a coat. My current go to, no frills lippie is Pink n' pout from Dermax. It's a colour changing lip balm that somehow brightens up my lips and stays there for a while despite my constant need to drink water. I use it with Holika's devil's plumper to somehow make my thin lips thicker. Love the spicy feeling of it too. I also use pink n' pout as a night lippie. It's been good to me.
My question would be, what are shades / lip tints that are super lightweight, non committal and uncomplicated? I already have strokes following the thought that I can layer their gloss and pen but I find it a bit too sticky/ heavy, which is a feeling I hate about lippies.
For 90s kids, remember the Lips candy that made your lips pink regardless of you ate it fast or slow? Or the kinagat lang lippie color? Going for that. :)",2,0,,t3_1cy3t0z,2024-05-25T04:09:14.645Z

‚Ä¢ work in thin layers. color correctors aren‚Äôt meant to completely conceal, they‚Äôre just used to cancel out the colors you‚Äôre trying to get rid of. your foundation and regular concealer are the ones that are meant to do the actual concealing.
‚Ä¢ you don‚Äôt have to set it with powder. do what your skin type and the products you use call for. if your undereyes get oily or the products you‚Äôre using tend to crease pag walang powder, then set it with powder but try a light dusting lang. but if you have really oily skin that needs baking then do that.

Lip oils are so nice and hydrating without being sticky, kinda reminds me of the EB Lip Oils that I also love. I got Chocolate Bar and Jellyfish Juice which are both wearable colors for everyday.
Definitely worth getting now since they are all less than Php 200.
I haven't opened the mascara and setting spray since I still have a few on rotation but I might eventually post a long term review.",11,0,,t3_1d77yqa,2024-06-04T07:26:23.300Z
t1_l70a902,Petal_Pixie24,"Makeup Brush
If you want affordable makeup brushes, I def recommend ovw. Though I thought na malaki yung isang brush for your base makeup kaso medyo maliit, so I'm planning on buying again maybe from another brand or from ovw din since they have a foundation brush that looks similar with rare beauty and vice co foundation brush.
Performance wise, it's very good naman. Very beginner friendly and especially if you are in a budget. Yung nabili ko is yung 4pcs na brush set, and if you are planning on buying that one and thinking na malaki yung flat brush for base, unfortunately hindi para lang siyang brush for your cream blush. But if ok lang naman for you, sige gaur.
Based from my experience, I can really say na maganda ang ovw brushes. Hindi siya masakit sa mukha, no tusok feeling, really gets and distributes the product well so hindi masasayang ang makeup mo.
But if you're still confused on what brush/set ang bibilhin ninyo, I suggest nalang din watching videos on YouTube. I specifically watched Joselle Alandy's video and that's how I decided on what brushes I wanted to buy.",10,0,,t3_1d77yqa,2024-06-04T02:26:09.585Z

You start with good skin prep and knowing your skin condition before makeup application. Also know your skin type so that you'll know what type of base you need.

t1_l70hy5a,purplemtsmajesty,"the brand i tried is lalalash,ph - i got the set na may kasama na glue and seal. sa isang eye, you can apply 4 or 5 clusters. the 'glue' is diff from the glue na usually ginagamit sa fake lashes na tinatanggal din at the end of the day. it's black tapos super sticky niya agad and it's like semi-solid parang plasticky-stretchy if that makes sense. so you put that sa base ng lashes and also put some sa cluster. didikit siya agad. then apply sealer after a few minutes. okay naman me with the application since i use din talaga cluster but with regular end of day glue.
does it last? yes if maayos talaga yung pag-apply ng glue and sealer. my first try may natanggal na at the end of the day. the second time tumagal na siya mga 3 days. but the thing is i think it gets more gross than lash extensions. may clumping kasi yung glue on me even if i only put a light layer. parang at the end of day 3 gusto ko na siya tanggalin because may build up na. it's also not easy to brush like lash extensions bc of the glue texture. and definitely wont last if u use oil cleanser.
the most impt factor kaya i will not repurchase - sobra dami natanggal na real lashes ko TT___TT i did not buy their remover (hindi kasama sa set) so idk if that really makes removing them easier. i just used my oil cleanser and hindi niya matatanggal fully yung glue, hindi siya nadidissolve. i still had to apply some force to peel the clusters away. tapos after matanggal na yung lashes andon pa rin yung glue sa real lashes ng ilang days huhu nakakabother as in. i feel like if it's this difficult dapat isama na yung remover sa set... or at least tell customers na need talaga ng remover.

It isnt life chaging. Main point lang of this liptint collection is their shade range, opaqueness and somehow accurate yung stain that it left except for the light shades the stain isnt as accurate as i expected it to be. It would apply kindda patchy on my dry ass lip, so moisturizing beforehand is key despite the product being moisturizing naman (maybe i just hv extremely dry lips) and yes it could also settles sa liplines. forgot to mention it has no minty feels similar to stroke‚Äôs lip oil na ramdam mo talaga.
tldr; nothing new formula wise, not minty, nor glossy na pasok sa standards ko. Its has just a beautiful shade range and opaquness is great talaga.

started pilling during colder weather

evens out skin tone but no coverage for blemishes
lightweight
feels like hs skin tint
pills
clings to dry patches

you might wanna try working in thin layers lang. try applying and spreading muna the product on the back of your hand then apply the thinest layer sa face mo. after spreading it na, use a makeup sponge to gently press the makeup sa skin mo. tip lang when applying sa nose area mo, push mo yung product and apply it in circular motion using ur finger!! iwasan mo din lagyan ng skin tint undereyes mo if nag cconcelaer ka na oara not too much product.
you might wanna research good undereyes hydrating creams ganyan.

Primer
Bobbi Brown Vitamin Enriched Face Base - yes, pricy but it really helps cheap makeup to last long (tried for both drugstore and high end products)
ELF Poreless Putty Primer - helps filling in pores during days that they seem more noticeable than usual
Foundation
Haus Labs Triclone Tech Foundation - forever holy grail, skin-like finish and so lightweight but still gives great coverage
NARS Light Reflecting Foundation - another lightweight buildable foundation that would last for hours
L'oreal True Match Nude Hyaluronic Tinted Serum - more like a really liquid-y foundation, feels like skin and sheer coverage but still buildable
Concealer
NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer - best for undereyes
Tarte Ultra Creamy Concealer - another hydrating formula that is best for undereyes
Hourglass Vanish Airbrush Concealer - cannot make this work for my undereyes but good for the no makeup days, spot concealing, etc.; not drying at all and a little goes a long way
NARS Soft Matte Complete Concealer - best for spot concealing; let it dry down first before putting on your foundation
Dior Forever Skin Correct - dries down so beautifully, has really nice skin-like coverage, can also be used for no-makeup makeup days
Powders
Huda Beauty Easy Bake Loose Powder - really fine powder and controls oil well; better than Givenchy because it's matte
Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Finish Setting Powder - holy grail powder, I barely need to blot at all whenever I use this
Setting Spray
Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray - holy grail for a lot of people for a reason, both cheap and high-end makeup can last long with this spray",4,1,t1_l66jlc4,1d1uvhe,2024-05-29T16:13:00.235Z

another cheaper option for you are the kaleidos quads, hindi mukhang jeje (though i remember them being a lot cheaper sa presyo dati) and these perform really well for me like medyo comparable na din sa natasha denona. they include 3 mattes and 1 glitter in each palette tapos theyre all pigmented and the glitter is so wet looking and sparkly and shimmery ‚ù§Ô∏è",3,1,t1_l5zfi7g,t3_1d1uvhe,2024-05-28T06:26:04.293Z
